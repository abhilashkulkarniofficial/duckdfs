The Shire was divided into four quarters, the Farthings already
referred to, North, South, East, and West; and these again each into
a number of folklands, which still bore the names of some of the old
leading families, although by the time of this history these names
were no longer found only in their proper folklands. Nearly all Tooks
still lived in the Tookland, but that was not true of many other
families, such as the Bagginses or the Boffins. Outside the Farthings
were the East and West Marches: the Buckland (p. 98); and the
Westmarch added to the Shire in S.R. 1452.
